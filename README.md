# PNC-xlsx-corrector


I downloaded an Excel file that was malformed, so I built this program to solve a very specific formatting issue. Every other element in column B needed to be shifted up and to the right 1, and every element in columns C and D needed to do the same thing(up 1, right 1).

I wrote this in the span of 1 hour, and it was my first experience with openpyxl, so the code is very inefficient/unoptimized. I was planning on optimizing this, but I'm currently designing a general excel manipulator that should be able to do a large number of specific/custom operations. 

**As a result, this project is only here for historical purposes.**
